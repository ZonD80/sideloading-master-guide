# FAQ

## Can I sideload \<xyz>.IPA

If it is an IPA, then you most likely **can** sideload it. \[guide]

## Can I sideload \<xyz> tweak

**Maybe**, it depends if the tweak requires root, and it depends if it needs `PreferenceLoader`. If the answer to those questions are yes, you are **unlikely** to be able to successfully sideload that tweak.

## Can I sideload on Windows?

Yes. See the page links below.

## Do I need to buy a developer account?

No! You can use a free one, however, apps will be limited to 7 days, at which point you will have to resign.

See the following:

{% content-ref url="../../providers/code-signing-services.md" %}
[code-signing-services.md](../../providers/code-signing-services.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../providers/code-signing-services-free.md" %}
[code-signing-services-free.md](../../providers/code-signing-services-free.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## I get a \<App ID limit> in Xcode:

This means you have created too many provisioning profiles in 7 days using a free account. You will be able to sideload again after that time elapses.

## My apps crash on startup! Help!

This is either (1) the provisioning profile expired, or (2) the app is incompatible, or (3) the tweak has not been applied correctly.
