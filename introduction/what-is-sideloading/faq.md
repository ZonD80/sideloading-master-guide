# FAQ

## Can I sideload &lt;xyz&gt;.IPA

If it is an IPA, then you most likely **can** sideload it. \[guide\]

## Can I sideload &lt;xyz&gt; tweak

**Maybe**, it depends if the tweak requires root, and it depends if it needs `PreferenceLoader`. If the answer to those questions are yes, you are **unlikely** to be able to successfully sideload that tweak.

## Can I sideload on windows?

Yes. See the page links below.

## Do I need to buy a developer account?

No! You can use a free one, however, apps will be limited to 7 days, at which point you will have to resign. 

See the following:

{% page-ref page="../../providers/code-signing-services.md" %}

## I get a &lt;App ID limit&gt; in Xcode:

This means you have created too many provisioning profiles in 7 days using a free account. You will be able to sideload again after that time elapses.

## My apps crash on startup! Help!

This is either \(1\) the provisioning profile expired, or \(2\) the app is incompatible, or \(3\) the tweak has not been applied correctly.
