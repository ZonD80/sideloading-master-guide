# What is sideloading?

> When referring to iOS devices,  "sideloading" means installing an app in IPA format onto an Apple Device, usually through the use of a computer program such as [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/), Xcode, on the actual device using a Jailbreak method or using a **signing service** instead of through Apple's App Store. On modern versions of iOS, the sources of the apps must be trusted by both Apple and the user in "profiles and device management" in settings; except when using jailbreak methods of sideloading apps.
