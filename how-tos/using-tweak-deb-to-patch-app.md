# Using tweak deb to patch app

## Method 1: [iPAPatcher ](https://github.com/brandonplank/iPAPatcher/releases)by brandonplank

### What is iPAPatcher?

iPAPatcher is a patching utility that lets you load dylibs into IPA application files to create tweaked apps. It is developed by developer and security researcher Brandon Plank. It is **not** a sideloading utility that signs and installs IPA files on your mobile device. iPAPatcher is a GUI for insert\_dylib – a program that forces an app to load a tweak’s dylib file.

In layman’s terms, it is a “tweak injector” that loads tweaks in stock App Store applications. 

### Limitations

* Tweaks that hook into system services will not work on a non-jailbroken device.
* Some tweaks require more than one dylib file or bundles to function properly. 

### Requirements

* Decrypted IPA file
